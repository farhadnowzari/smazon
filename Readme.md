# Smazon

This project is to do an experiment with SingleSpa, React and Vue to prototype Amazon first page. We implement microfrontends with `Vue` and `React` and put them together with `SingleSpa` to create the main page.

* **navbar-single-spa** is the navbar which is implemented with reactjs.
* **shop** is part of the amazon home page implemented in vuejs.
* **smazon** is the `roo-config` project or the container-app from single-spa.
